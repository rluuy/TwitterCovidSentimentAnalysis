# twitter_sentiment_analyzer

Final Project Submitted for a Computational Linguistics Course at the University of Arizona.

The Twitter_Sentiment_Analyzer performs web-scrapping on Twitter using the tweepy API to grab tweets related to the corona-virus across multiple different
cities in the United States. Then that data is passed into Google's Natural Language API to grab sentiment data to compare and contrast 
uctuation of emotions regarding COVID-19.
